My research interests are in the areas of health Economcs, labour and welfare economics, and applied econometrics.

In my research PhD , I investigate the effects of the introduction and annual upratng in the National Living Wage in the UK on health and wellbeing, with specific consideration of the counteracting impacts of the freeze to working age welfare benefits between 2016 and 2020.

In the summer of 2022, I was a Research Intern with the Scottish Government in the Health and Social Care Analysis Division. I contributed to work on ways of measuring the long-term benefits of the National Care Service as part of the analysis supporting the development of the National Care Service for Scotland.
