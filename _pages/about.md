I am a [PhD candidate in Economics](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/lateef-akanni) at the [University of Strathclyde Business School](https://www.strath.ac.uk/business/economics/). My research interests are in the fields of Health Economics, Welfare Economics, and Applied Econometrics.

My PhD research is on the effects of the introduction and annual uprating in the National Living Wage in the UK on health and wellbeing, with specific consideration of the counteracting impacts of the freeze to working-age welfare benefits between 2016 and 2020.

In the summer of 2022, I was a Research Intern with the Scottish Government in the Health and Social Care Analysis Division. I contributed to work on ways of measuring the long-term benefits of the National Care Service as part of the analysis supporting the development of the National Care Service for Scotland.
