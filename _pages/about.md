I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/business/economics/).
My expected graduation date is September 2023. My research interests are in Health Economcs, Labour and Welfare economics.

My PhD research investigates the impact of the introduction and annual uprating of the UK's National Living Wage on health outcomes, with a consideration of the effects of counteracting economic policies, particularly the benefit freeze programme that was implemented between 2016 and 2020.
