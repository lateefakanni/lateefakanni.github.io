I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/business/economics/).
My expected graduation date is September 2023. I am specialised in applied and health economics and my research interests are in the areas of  health and labour economic,. education, and welfare economics.

My research investigates the impact of the introduction and annual uprating of the UK's National Living Wage on health outcomes, with a consideration of the effects of counteracting economic policies, particularly the benefit freeze programme that was implemented between 2016 and 2020.
